By imposing a concentration boundary condition (*Dirichlet* type) we explicitly assume that both the upper and lower boundaries are infinite; that is, the boundary values remain fixed regardless of what happens inside the model.

In the present example we are effectively stating that there is an infinite supply of methane at the base of the core, which is unlikely to be realistic.\n\nWe could try to resort to a so called *Neuman* boundary condition where, instead of  concentration, we state that there should be no change in concentration, i.e., the gradient of the concentration equals zero.
